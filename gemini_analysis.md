# Performance Analysis: Canadian Bank Stocks (2019–2026)

This analysis examines the year-over-year (YoY) movements of the "Big Six" Canadian banks: TD, Royal Bank (RY), National Bank (NA), BMO, Scotiabank (BNS), and CIBC (CM).

## Macro-Correlation Patterns

The most striking pattern is the high degree of directional synchronization. Despite individual rankings, the banks largely move as a single asset class:

Universal Down Years: In 2019, 2021 (slight), and 2023, almost all banks posted negative or flat growth. When the sector faces headwinds (regulatory changes, interest rate shifts, or economic slowdowns), no single bank is immune.

Universal Up Years: 2020, 2022, 2024 (mostly), 2025 (mostly), and 2026 show the entire sector rising. 2022 and 2026 stand out as "Explosive Growth" years where every bank posted double-digit gains.

## The "National Bank" Consistency (The Outperformer)

National Bank (NA) exhibits a unique "High-Floor" pattern.

Stability in Rankings: Across 8 years, NA never dropped below Rank 4.

The Recovery Leader: In years of recovery or high growth (2020, 2022, 2024, 2025), it consistently secured a Top 2 spot.

Resilience: Even in "down" years like 2023, it outperformed its larger peers (TD, BMO, BNS, CM) by losing less value percentage-wise.

## Scotiabank vs. CIBC: The "Rebound" Duo

There is a notable inverse relationship in how these two stocks recover relative to the "Stable" banks (RY/TD):

Laggard Periods: Scotiabank (BNS) and CIBC (CM) frequently occupied the bottom two slots (Rank 5 and 6) during 2019, 2022, and 2023.

The Rubber-Band Effect: When CIBC and Scotiabank underperform significantly in one cycle, they often lead the next. CIBC went from Rank 5 in 2023 to Rank 1 in 2024 and 2025.

Divergence: While BNS and CM often move together, 2024-2025 showed a decoupling where CIBC surged to the top while BNS remained in the bottom half.

## The TD "Volatility Pivot"

TD Bank exhibits a "Boom or Bust" pattern relative to the group:

Underperformance Streak: From 2021 to 2025, TD was consistently in the bottom half of the rankings (Ranks 4, 4, 3, 5, 6).

The 2026 Surge: After being the worst performer in 2025 (-10.72%), it pivoted to become the absolute leader in 2026 with a massive +69.70% gain. This suggests TD acts as a "coiled spring" stock—protracted underperformance often leads to the most violent upward correction in the group.

## Year-Over-Year Ranking Volatility

The data shows that Rank 1 is rarely held by the same bank for more than two consecutive years:

2019: TD

2020: NA

2021: RY

2022: BMO

2023: RY

2024-2025: CM (The only consecutive leader)

2026: TD

## Price-Point Correlation

There is a loose correlation between share price and growth percentage:

Higher Entry (RY, BMO): These stocks tend to have more "moderate" swings. While they participate in the rallies, their percentage gains are often eclipsed by the lower-priced stocks (CM, NA) during high-volatility years like 2026.

Lower Entry (CM, NA, TD): These stocks appear more sensitive to market sentiment, leading to the triple-digit percentage swings seen in the latter half of the data set.

## Summary Conclusion

The Canadian bank stocks move in a cyclical "Catch-Up" pattern. When one bank (like TD or CIBC) significantly underperforms the group for 1-2 years, it tends to lead the next major sector rally. National Bank remains the "anchor," providing the most consistent year-over-year rankings regardless of whether the market is bullish or bearish.
